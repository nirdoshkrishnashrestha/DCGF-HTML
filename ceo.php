<p><strong>Dear Stakeholders,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Warm Greeting to Everyone!!</strong></p>
<p>At the foremost, I would like to express my heartiest thank to our investors (viz. Government of Nepal &amp; Nepal Rastra Bank), BFIs and DCGF for their invaluable support and effort. Likewise, I am equally thankful to the Ministry of Finance and team for their guidance and kind cooperation. I am also indebted to the Chairman and Board of Directors for having trust in me and extending their guardianship as always. Indeed, I feel privileged to be appointed as the CEO of the Fund. My sincere gratefulness to all of them.</p>
<p>It is important for us to reflect on the past performance and focus on the future. I must say, we are proud of what we have achieved in the part, and take this opportunity to share some key indicators as we move forward in our journey. Having completed 48 years of operation, we are growing bigger and stronger, and have proved ourselves to be a trustworthy and only financial safety net of the nation which drives its business through knowledge, expertise, dedication and BFI's focused services.</p>
<p>All our fundamental parameters are good and financially stable. Further, I am delighted to reveal that we have been working on diversifying our products and services with enhanced benefits to BFI's. The ratio of our premium collection and claim payout is quite reasonable and satisfying, which itself reflects the level of our service, trust and confidence of the BFI's on us. This has been achievable predominantly with the support of our stakeholders who are actively associated with us, and of course, the relentless efforts of the employees. They all deserves to be applauded.</p>
<p>We will continuously strive to improve the performance for achieving our goals. We will strategically plan our approach in order to meet and adjust to the changing business environment with core focus on sustainable growth. The Fund expresses its firm commitment to further enhance and diversify its sectors and services so as to grasp the international standards altering its traditional practices and mechanism. In addition, to improve the current work done by the fund regarding deposit guarantee and credit guarantee from the same organization, the fund will be partitioned into two separate institutions which shall oversee deposit guarantee and credit guarantee separately and give reliable and qualitative services.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that all our stakeholders will continue granting us their long-term support and encouragement. From us, we will work even harder and push forward vigorously to realize the vision and mission of the Fund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>रमेश घिमिरे</p>
